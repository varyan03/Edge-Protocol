## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

Because this project uses ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), you cannot run it by just opening the `index.html` file directly from your filesystem (due to browser security policies). You must run it from a local server.

**The Easiest Way:**

1.  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2.  2.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
3.  Install the `serve` package (if you don't have it):
    ```sh
    npm install -g serve
    ```
4.  Run the server:
    ```sh
    serve
    ```
5.  Open your browser and go to the URL it provides (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

**Python (Alternative):**

If you have Python 3 installed, you can run this command from the project's root directory:

```sh
python -m http.server
